## Investigating Voter Power in Low-Turnout NYC Communities

This project explores who holds decision-making power in New York City communities with low voter turnout, particularly focusing on underrepresented low-income and immigrant populations. Using data from the NYC Campaign Finance Board, CUNY Graduate Center, and the NYC Board of Elections, I analyzed electoral engagement across NYC council districts.

Key insights were derived from merging datasets to identify districts where low-income and immigrant populations are underrepresented. I focused on the 2021 general election for city council members, as it offered the most relevant snapshot of local voter turnout.

The project combined quantitative data with qualitative street interviews conducted in five districts, revealing that many voters are unaware of the importance of local elections. Additionally, poverty and socio-economic factors in districts like District 16 significantly impact voter participation.

Despite challenges in engaging elected officials, conversations with organizations such as the League of Women Voters provided valuable perspectives on voter barriers and efforts to increase civic engagement.

This project highlights the complexities of voter participation in NYC, offering a data-driven look into how electoral underrepresentation can be addressed.
